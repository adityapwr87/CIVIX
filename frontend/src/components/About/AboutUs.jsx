        <p>
          Empowering citizens to take charge of their communities, one issue at
          a time.

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          CivicTracker was created to bridge the gap between citizens and civic
          authorities. We believe that reporting a pothole, a broken
          streetlight, or a sanitation issue should be simple and effective. Our
          platform enables users to not just report problems, but also track
          their progress and see real change happen.

        <h2>What We Stand For</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Transparency:</strong> Everyone should be able to see what's
            being fixed and what's not.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Community:</strong> Civic issues impact us all. Working
            together makes us stronger.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Action:</strong> Reporting should lead to resolution, not
            just a dead end.
          </li>
